            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p>My name is Martín R. I inherited this business from my family and am continuing to uphold the Roca surname, which has been distinguished.</p>
            <p>Roca transcended Latin America in the 1990s and reached Milan. He was an illustrious figure and a PREFERRED student of Vicente Forte, a visual artist and painter born on May 22, 1928 (of the same era as Jesús Rafael Soto) in Capital Federal, who lived and worked in General Belgrano until his death in July 2006.</p>
            <p>He studied with Arístides Fumagalli and Vicente Forte, and his work is characterized by the strength of his brushstrokes and his exploration of light and color.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Roca participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions, receiving several awards and recognitions. He was declared of provincial interest by Decree No. 795/94, and his work continues to be recognized and celebrated today.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS, HE WAS NEVER IN THE MARKET. HIS ABSTRACT AND FIGURATIVE ART WAS A FUSION OF EMOTION AND TECHNIQUE, CREATING WORKS THAT INVITE REFLECTION AND CONNECTION. WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL CAREER, HE EXHIBITED IN ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, AND EUROPE, RECEIVING AWARDS AND MENTIONS AS AN AMATEUR. HIS WORKS HAVE BEEN DECLARED OF PROVINCIAL INTEREST AND RECOGNIZED BY MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES IN ARGENTINA. HOWEVER, HIS LIFE WAS VERY SIMILAR TO VAN GOGH'S; HE DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE MARKET AND DEDICATE HIMSELF FULLY TO ART. TODAY, 19 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, WE HAVE DECIDED TO BRING HIS WORKS OF OVER 50 YEARS TO LIGHT.</p>
            <p>As an heir to this artistic current, I am committed to connecting with art enthusiasts and bringing to light his creative power.</p>
            <p>I have all the documentation. There are a total of 515 works, with 40 active for sale to start, and the rest may be sold later, possibly in collections, along with 707 images for prints and NFTs.</p>

            <h3>ROCA RECREATED LANDSCAPES AND EXPLORED THE ADVENTURE OF LIGHT AND COLOR WITH EASE</h3>
            <p>ROCA'S WORKS AMAZE WITH THEIR BOLD BRUSHSTROKES AND ORDERLY COMPOSITION. HIS ABSTRACT VISION SOMETIMES BECOMES A FIGURATIVE PROPOSITION, ALMOST HIDDEN.</p>
            <p>The atmosphere he achieves is rooted in a poetic metaphysics structured by planes and curves, gaining strength from solitude. Despite the absence of figures, his work composes powerful, evocative unrealities. He preferred verticality in composition, seemingly opposing conventional horizontal painting. In 1994, his artistic work was declared of provincial interest through Decree No. 795/94. ROCA held numerous solo exhibitions in Argentina and abroad, receiving several awards and mentions throughout his career. In 1996, the Provincial Museum of Fine Arts in La Plata dedicated a retrospective to him. In 2010, a selection of his major paintings was exhibited.</p>
