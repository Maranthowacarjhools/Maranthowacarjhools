Roca: Artist and Legacy

## About Martín Roca

My name is Martín R. I inherited this business from the family and am continuing to uphold the Roca name, which has been distinguished in its artistic position. His works have been showcased here in Europe; he was exceptionally talented but remained an outsider in the market.

He gained prominence in Latin America in the 1990s and reached Milan, where he was an eminent figure and a favored student of Vicente Forte.

Roca was born on May 22, 1928 (the same era as Jesús Rafael Soto) in Capital Federal and lived and worked in General Belgrano until his passing in July 2006.

He studied with Arístides Fumagalli and Vicente Forte, and his work is known for its powerful strokes and exploration of light and color.

Throughout his career, Roca participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions, receiving several awards and recognitions. He was declared of provincial interest by Decree No. 795/94, and his work continues to be recognized and celebrated today.

As an heir to this artistic tradition, I am committed to connecting with art enthusiasts and revealing its creative power.

## Analysis of His Works

The atmosphere achieved is rooted in a poetic metaphysics structured by planes and curves, gaining strength from solitude. Despite the absence of figures, his work composes powerful evocative unrealities.

He preferred verticality in composition, seemingly opposing conventional horizontal painting. In 1994, his artistic work was declared of provincial interest through Decree No. 795/94. Roca held numerous solo exhibitions in Argentina and abroad, receiving several awards and mentions throughout his career.

In 1996, the Provincial Museum of Fine Arts in La Plata dedicated a retrospective to him. In 2010, a selection of his major paintings was exhibited at MACLA & Europa Milan.
